*****Whack A Mole*****
What's going on here?
Its everyone's childhood favorite. Use a wooden mallet to whack a mole back into the ground it popped out of. It's fun, it's infuriating.  The mole is always one step ahead. Is he really that smart or is there a pattern to his diabolical escape?  It seems like he only speads up. Find out if you can defeat the mole with your lightning fast finger or superior mind. 

(Post - originally planned to have the level change introduce a predictable pattern where the player could start to predict future movements of the mole making a wack more successful. However, my lofty goal did not make sense once thinking that it would be marginally different versus just increasing the speed and movement of the mole.)

Become the envy of all your friends with a trophy from this classic.

*****Tech Stack*****
html, css, javascript, dom, paint.net

(Post - all tech was used plus a download of .mp3 file to give a dynamic sound)

*****MVP*****
Render a start screen with game-play instructions and a start button, and player mode button for up to two players
Render game screen displaying the canvas, turn counter, and current stage
Render a wooden mallet that can move using the mouse pointer
Render the moles prarie where he hides 
Render a mole that can move up and down the Y axis and side to side on the X axis`
Render a grouping of stars that display when the mole is struck by the wooden mallet
Record the most hits` on the mole in the before the timer ends 
Render next level where the mole's movement speed is increased

(Post - rather than making the game two players I opted to have it record the high score of each player.  This made more sense since the game would be played from the same computer sharing a mouse.  )

*****Stretch Goals*****
Render coin collector to purchase level up items
Render level up items like bigger malet for more damage
Render shop to purchase level up items

(Post - my stretch goals were too ambitous. It took this experiece to understand how much time goes into making slight alterations.)

*****Potential Roadblocks*****
sorting logic that toggles between random function and a set pattern function
creating image that can appear to grow and shrink into the moles hiding place

(Post - the first roadblock I simply changed direction and opted out of. The hiding pattern was challenging.  The biggest challenge was rendering a mallet that when striking an object would register where the mallet was striking it which was pushed away from the pointer hidden off side from it.)
